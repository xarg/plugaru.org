![Alex Plugaru](/images/alex-plugaru.jpg "Alex Plugaru")

I'm Alex Plugaru. I live in New York City. I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur with 20+ years of experience.
When I'm not working on startups, I'm either spending time in nature (hiking/kayaking/fishing/over-landing with my
4runner), relaxing with my family and friends, reading some hard sci-fi, baking cakes, or making something with electronics.

I'm also the co-founder and CTO of [Gorgias](https://www.gorgias.com), a customer relationship platform (CRM) used by
thousands of ecommerce businesses worldwide. We help brands deliver exceptional customer service at scale.

This blog is about startups, software engineering, management, book reviews and random thoughts.

You can also find me on [github](https://github.com/xarg), [twitter](https://twitter.com/humanfromearth) or by email first name at this domain dot org.
