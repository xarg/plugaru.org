I'm Alex Plugaru, software engineer and entrepreneur based in New York City with 20+ years of experience.
As the co-founder and CTO of [Gorgias](https://www.gorgias.com), I help ecommerce brands provide exceptional customer 
experience through our CRM platform used by thousands of brands worldwide.

When I'm not working, I try to spend my time in nature, relaxing with my family and friends, reading some hard sci-fi 
book, baking cakes, or making something with electronics.

This blog covers startups, software engineering, management, book summaries and other random things.
